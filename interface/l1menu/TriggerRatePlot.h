		 *                              the plots made for it, e.g. with the correct eta cuts already set. The other thresholds are

		 *                              is copied so these cannot be changed afterwards.
		 * @param[in] pHistogram        The root histogram to fill with the rates. This should be set up with the required binning
		 *                              beforehand. The title is changed to record the trigger name, version, parameter plotted against
		 *                              and other parameter values.
		 * @param[in] versusParameter   The trigger parameter to plot along the x-axis. Defaults to "threshold1".
		 * @param[in] scaledParameters  A list of parameters that should be scaled along with the versusParameter. The ratio between each
		 *                              parameter and the versusParameter at the time of construction is kept as the versusParameter is
